# Trope patterns — the printed cantillation chart, transcribed

The Trope Tutor's Learn-card staffs follow the standard Ashkenazi melodies as printed in the
teacher's cantillation chart: Appendix H, *Torah Cantillation* (41 numbered phrase patterns, treble
clef, three sharps = A major), the source of `data/trope/trope_motifs.json`, and *High Holiday Torah
Cantillation* (33 patterns, no key signature), the source of `data/trope/trope_motifs_hh.json`. This
file is the transcription of those pages, every row note for note, read from clean scans of the
chart. The scans are not in the repository (the pages are copyrighted); the melodies themselves are
traditional. This transcription is CC BY-SA 4.0, like the data files it feeds.

**Sections B and C are data.** `node scripts/build-trope-phrases.mjs` reads their row blocks and writes
`data/trope/trope_phrases.json` — every row's notes, syllables, triplets, ties and slurs, the input for
a staff of a whole parasha (section G) — together with `docs/trope_phrases_report.md`, which lists
every figure of every mark in every context the chart prints and checks the tutor's staffs against
their rows. To change a note, edit its row here and re-run the builder; never edit the JSON.

## How to read this file

- **Pitches** are scientific pitch names as printed in the treble clef: C4 is middle C, A3 the A
  below it, so the Torah chart lives between A3 and B4 and the High Holiday chart between G3 and
  B♭4 (men sing both an octave lower).
- **Key and accidentals.** In the Torah chart every F, C and G is sharp unless a natural sign is
  printed; the rows write every one of them with its sign (`F♯4`, `C♯4`, `G♮4`), so a letter without
  one cannot pass for a misreading, and the builder refuses any accidental the chart does not print.
  A row has no bar lines, so a printed accidental holds to the end of its row: mercha kefula's second
  G carries no sign and is G♮ (row 39). The High Holiday chart has no key signature and prints each
  accidental where it wants one: a flat on `B♭`, and one sharp, on telisha ketana's `F♯`.
- **Scale degrees** are given relative to A for the Torah chart (A = 1, B = 2, C♯ = 3, D = 4,
  E = 5, F♯ = 6, G♯ = 7; ′ is the octave above). The tutor stores `p` = semitones from B4 (B♭4 = −1,
  A4 = −2, G4 = −4, F♯4 = −5, F4 = −6, E4 = −7, D4 = −9, C♯4 = −10, C4 = −11, B3 = −12, A3 = −14,
  G3 = −16).
- **The row blocks** (sections B and C) are fenced ` ```trope-torah ` / ` ```trope-hh ` blocks:

  ```
  #<row> [tag] <the Hebrew names, pointed and marked as printed>
  <mark>  <SYL>[-] <note> <note> … <SYL>[-] <note> …
  ```

  - The first line is the row number (High Holiday row 20's parenthesized second setting is `#20b`;
    the chart gives it no Hebrew of its own, so it repeats row 20's). Then come the tags, right after
    the number and in lowercase: `[aliyah-end]` for the closing formula of an aliyah's last verse
    (Torah 41, High Holiday 30–33), `[unverified]` for a row the scans could not settle (none is).
    Then the Hebrew exactly as printed, with its points, dagesh and marks on the letters where the
    chart puts them (High Holiday row 12, whose printed line is a misprint, follows its staff; see
    section C). It holds no brackets or Latin letters, and its marks must name the same marks as the
    lines below, one for one: ׃ counts as sof pasuk, a ׀ after a munach makes it munach legarmeh,
    and telisha gedola, printed at both ends of its name, counts once.
  - Then one line per mark, left to right as printed. The mark is the tutor's key (`TROPES` in
    `trope_tutor.html`) or `munach_legarmeh`.
  - A syllable (MER, CHA, T′ …) starts at the note printed above it and runs to the next syllable; a
    `-` after it means the next syllable continues the same word. Each mark's line is whole words, so
    its last syllable has no `-`, and every syllable has at least one sounding note.
  - A note is `PITCH(VALUE)`, with `,>` for an accent and `,-` for a tenuto line. Values: `32` a
    thirty-second, `s` a sixteenth, `ds` a dotted sixteenth, `e` an eighth, `de` a dotted eighth, `q` a
    quarter, `dq` a dotted quarter, `h` a half, `dh` a dotted half, `g` a grace note (small; no time of
    its own). `rest(e)` is a rest.
  - Before a note, `~` is a slur arriving from the note before, `~~` a dashed slur, `=` a tie (one
    held sound) and `~=` a tie under a slur. A tie stays inside one mark's line and never touches a
    grace note, and a slur never arrives from a rest.
  - `3{` … `}` wraps a printed triplet: at least two sounding notes whose written values add up to
    three of one value, sung in the time of two (usually three eighths or three sixteenths; High
    Holiday rows 5–6 write e e s s). The values inside are the printed ones, and a triplet may run
    from one mark's line into the next.
  - Beams are not written: they follow from the values.

## A. One figure per mark (the Learn-card staffs)

Each Learn card draws one figure per melody: the mark's line in the row named below. For a
disjunctive that is usually a row where it stands alone or ends the phrase; a connecting mark, and
pashta, tipcha, yetiv and zarka, which never end a row, come from a row where they lead into their
usual partner. The staff has four values (`d` 1–4: eighth, quarter,
dotted quarter, half), so a row is read onto it like this: a grace note becomes an eighth, tied notes
become one held note, rests drop, anything shorter than a quarter is drawn as an eighth (a dotted
eighth or a triplet note included), and a longer note takes the nearest of the other three values.
The builder checks every staff against its row on each run (`docs/trope_phrases_report.md` → *The
Trope Tutor's staffs against their rows*); the figures themselves, for both melodies and in every
context, are listed in the same report.

| Mark (tutor key) | Torah row | High Holiday row | On the staff |
|---|---|---|---|
| mercha | 1 | 1 | |
| tipcha | 4 | 4 | |
| munach (before etnachta) | 2 | 2 | |
| etnachta | 4 | 4 | |
| sof_pasuk | 8 | 8 | |
| mahpach | 11 | 11 | |
| pashta | 13 | 10 | |
| yetiv | 33 | 24 | Y′ is sung on a grace note, drawn as an eighth |
| zakef_katon | 13 | 10 | |
| zakef_gadol | 31 | 25 | |
| zarka | 37 | 29 | Torah: the grace note on F♯4 before KA is drawn as an eighth |
| segol | 37 | 29 | |
| shalshelet | 38 | — | |
| revia | 19 | 16 | |
| darga | 21 | 13 | |
| tevir | 22 | 13 | |
| kadma (in kadma v'azla) | 15 | 20 | |
| geresh (azla) | 16 | 21 | |
| gershayim | 20 | 22 | |
| telisha_ketana | 29 | 18 | Torah: T′ is sung on a grace note, drawn as an eighth |
| telisha_gedola | 28 | 17 | Torah: as telisha ketana |
| pazer | 30 | 19 | Torah: PA-ZER's two D4s are held as one quarter — the maintainer's correction of the print; the High Holiday staff keeps both |
| mercha_kefula | 39 | — | |
| karnei_parah | 40 | — | |
| yerach_ben_yomo | 40 | — | |
| munach legarmeh (no card) | 17 | 15 | |
| sof pasuk at the end of an aliyah (no card) | 41 | 30–33 | |

`geresh_muqdam` has no figure in either chart and no entry (it never occurs in the Torah text either;
see section G). Shalshelet, mercha kefula, karnei parah and yerach ben yomo have no High Holiday row:
they never occur in the Rosh Hashanah or Yom Kippur readings (the census in section G checks this).

The lowered seventh is printed with a natural sign (G♮) in the Torah chart's darga, telisha gedola,
pazer, mercha kefula and karnei parah, and on the munach before zarka (rows 34–35); the High Holiday
chart writes it B♭ (pazer, kadma v'azla, geresh). Articulation is printed, not left to the reader:
accents on shalshelet's B4, zarka's C♯4 and karnei parah's E4 and A4, tenuto lines on pazer's
B4 A4 F♯4 and zakef gadol's ZA-KEF-GA; in the High Holiday chart, accents on the last three notes of
zakef gadol and pazer and tenuto dashes on zarka's closing B3 A3 G3. The staffs do not draw these marks.

## B. The 41 Torah phrase patterns

Read note for note from the clean scans, once by hand and once more independently; the two readings
were compared note by note and every difference was settled at 8–12× zoom, and every row was then
engraved back from the data and laid under its scan. A pixel note-head detector agreed with every
pitch it could measure.

**What the clean scans changed.** The earlier reading of this chart came from rougher photographs.
Against it, the clean scans show:

- **Closing notes held.** Mahpach's closing D4 (rows 9–11, 14), tevir's closing E4 (22–27),
  telisha gedola's closing D4 (28), pazer's closing E4 (30), zarka's closing A3 (34–37) and karnei
  parah's closing D4 (40) are quarter notes.
- **Tevir's VIR** is a triplet of quarters, D4 C♯4 D4 (22–27).
- **Faster runs.** Revia's D4 C♯4 (17–19) and gershayim's E4 D4 E4 (20) are thirty-seconds.
  Telisha gedola's run opens with four sixteenths, D4 E4 F♯4 G♮4 (28), and shalshelet's run is
  sixteenths (38), with LET printed under the closing A4. Zakef gadol's B4 A4 are sixteenths, and
  GA carries a tenuto line like ZA and KEF (31).
- **Yetiv** (32–33): Y′ is sung on a grace note on B4, which the earlier reading took for an eighth
  rest. It is the same device as the High Holiday yetiv's Y′.
- **Zarka** (34–37): the accent sits on the C♯4 before the closing A3. The grace F♯4 is printed
  before KA, and KA starts on the dotted E4.
- **Munach before segol** (34, 36): the A3 is an eighth, and the D4 after it is tied into a sixteenth.
- **Karnei parah** (40): FA's triplet (D4 C♯4 D4) is followed by an accented E4 and a D4 before
  the closing run. The earlier reading missed the E4. RA is printed under the triplet's C♯4.
- **Smaller rhythm corrections**, none of which reaches a staff: zakef katon's KA is a sixteenth,
  not an eighth (rows 9–14, 32); the mercha before tevir ends on an eighth, not a dotted eighth (24,
  26); T′ is an eighth in row 26; telisha ketana's run is in sixteenths (29); zarka's accented C♯4 is
  an eighth (34–37); karnei parah's accented A4 and the F♯4 E4 after it are eighths (40); and in row
  41 a triplet runs from the second mercha's CHA into sof pasuk.
- **Row 41 is settled.** Its last note is B3: measured 1½ spaces below the staff, where the print
  leaves out the ledger line. The two small notes between PA and SUK are grace notes, E4 F♯4.

The tutor's staffs were corrected to match (section E).

## C. The 33 High Holiday phrase patterns

The set has no key signature and sits on C/D: its sof pasuk ends on C4, its etnachta on D4. Its
accidentals are the B♭4 of pazer, kadma v'azla and geresh (rows 19–21; B3 below stays natural) and
the F♯ in telisha ketana's run (row 18). Rows 1–8 pair with Torah rows 1–8, and rows 30–33 are
the end-of-aliyah endings. Row 20 prints a second, parenthesized setting of kadma v'azla, given
here as `#20b`.

These rows were read in the same two independent passes as section B, with every difference settled
at 8–12×.

**What the clean scans changed.** The earlier table here was a first pass, "pitch by pitch from the
photographs with the rhythm sketched". The per-mark figures had already been re-read from zoomed crops,
and all but one stand; the rhythm is now as printed:

- **Dotted pairs.** For example etnachta's TA is F4 E4 as a dotted eighth and a sixteenth.
- **Thirty-second runs.** Revia's I, zarka's KA, segol's GOL, gershayim's YIM, tevir's VIR and the
  end-of-aliyah tipcha.
- **Triplets that run from one mark into the next.** Munach into etnachta (rows 1–2), mercha into
  sof pasuk (5–6), munach into zarka (26, 28), mercha into tipcha (30–31) and kadma into azla (20b).
- **Rests.** An eighth rest follows pashta (9–12), munach legarmeh (15), the munach before the
  telishas and pazer (17–19), yetiv (23–24), zarka (26–29) and the end-of-aliyah tipcha (30–33).

Notes that differ from the earlier readings (the first-pass table, or the per-mark figures re-read
from zoomed crops):

- **The munach before the telishas and pazer** (17–19) is C4, then E4 D4. The C4 is an eighth: the
  figure re-reading took it for a grace note, and the first pass left it out.
- **The munach before revia** (15–16) holds its G4: a quarter tied to an eighth in row 15, two tied
  eighths in row 16.
- **Munach legarmeh** (15) is D4 B3 D4 in eighths.
- **The end-of-aliyah rows** (30–33). Tipcha's CHA is an A4 tied into a thirty-second run,
  A4 G4 F4 E4, then D4. The mercha before sof pasuk is E4 F4 E4, not D4 D4 E4 (row 30) or E4 D4 E4
  (row 32).
- **Row 20b** (the second kadma v'azla) ends A4 G4, the G4 a dotted quarter. There is no E4.
- **Zarka's closing B3 A3 G3** each carry a short dash above the stem, read as a tenuto. The
  first pass took these dashes for notes.
- **Segol** (26–29). SE is a sixteenth, and GOL's G4 is tied into the first note of its run under
  the long slur, so the figure sings two G4s, not the figure re-reading's three. All four rows print
  the same figure. Its closing D4 is tied into a quarter. The High Holiday segol staff was corrected
  (section E).

**One misprint in the chart:** row 12's Hebrew line repeats row 9's words (קַדְמָא מַהְפַּךְ פַּשְׁטָא
מֻנַּח קָטֹן), but its staff sings MU-NACH MA-PACH PASH-TA KA-TON. The block's header follows the staff.

## D. What the chart teaches beyond single marks

- **Connecting marks change shape with the pause they lead into.** Munach:
  - before etnachta: E4, then D4–B3 (rows 1–2);
  - before zakef katon: F♯4, then F♯4–E4–F♯4 (9, 10, 12, 14; after yetiv, row 32, MU is a sixteenth);
  - before mahpach and darga: A4, then A4–F♯4–A4 (14, 27);
  - before revia: E4, then A4–F♯4 as the start of a triplet (17–18);
  - before the telishas and pazer: D4, then F♯4–E4 (28–30);
  - before zarka: G♮4, then F♯4–E4 (34–35);
  - before segol: A3, then a D4 tied into a sixteenth (34, 36).

  The munach legarmeh of row 17 is a six-note figure of its own. Mercha is C♯4–E4 before tipcha but
  F♯4, then A4–E4, before tevir (24, 26). Kadma is A3–D4 in kadma v'azla but D4–F♯4 before mahpach,
  darga and mercha (9, 25, 26). The report lists every such figure with the marks around it.
- **Short pickups vary between rows that look alike.** Mercha's CHA is a dotted eighth before tipcha
  and a plain eighth before sof pasuk (row 5). T′ is an eighth in rows 22 and 26 but a sixteenth in 23–25
  and 27, and DAR is an eighth in 21 and 23 but a sixteenth in 25 and 27. A note after a dotted eighth
  is usually a sixteenth. The data keeps each variant as printed.
- **Azla is the geresh melody.** The tail of kadma v'azla (row 15) sings the same four pitches as the
  geresh of row 16 (A4 F♯4 B4 A4; the geresh holds its B4), after two quick notes of its own: the
  azla is a geresh sung after a kadma. The card note says the same of kadma, "usually leading
  straight into a geresh".
- **The last verse of an aliyah has its own ending** (row 41; High Holiday rows 30–33): a higher,
  longer formula in which mercha and tipcha change as well as sof pasuk. The tutor's sof pasuk card
  does not show it. The Torah chart prints it only for mercha–tipcha–mercha–sof pasuk. The High Holiday
  chart prints all four common closings; see section G for how often each occurs.
- **The lowered seventh.** The Torah chart never sings G♯: every G is G♮, so the melody is
  Mixolydian though the signature says A major. The High Holiday chart flattens only its upper B,
  B♭4 in pazer, kadma v'azla and geresh (rows 19–21); B3 below stays natural in sof pasuk, zarka and
  munach legarmeh.
- **Ornaments are notated, not improvised.** Grace notes:
  - in front of zarka's KA;
  - under the telishas' T′ and yetiv's Y′;
  - before the end-of-aliyah SUK.

  Triplets sit inside tevir, gershayim and karnei parah, and run from one word into the next in
  munach–revia and the end-of-aliyah phrase (rows 17–18, 41). In the High Holiday chart they sit
  inside pazer, geresh, zakef gadol and segol, and the ones that cross from one mark into the next are
  listed in section C. Accents and tenuto lines are listed in section A.
- **The chart's own order is a teaching order:**
  - the etnachta clause (1–4);
  - the sof pasuk clause (5–8);
  - the zakef katon clause (9–14);
  - kadma v'azla and geresh (15–16);
  - revia (17–19);
  - gershayim (20);
  - darga and tevir (21–27);
  - the telishas and pazer (28–30);
  - zakef gadol and yetiv (31–33);
  - the segol clause (34–37);
  - the rare marks (38–40);
  - the closing formula (41).

## E. How the tutor uses this

- Every entry in `data/trope/trope_motifs.json` is `verified: true` and carries
  `source: "tropepatterns.md Torah #N"`, the row in section B that section A names.
  - The motif builder (`scripts/build-trope-motifs.mjs`) copies verified entries through untouched;
    only `--force` would replace them with machine drafts.
  - `scripts/build-trope-phrases.mjs` checks on each run that each motif file carries exactly the
    cards section A's table names, each `verified: true` with the `source` the table gives, and that
    every entry equals its row reduced as section A says. It fails on any difference, printing the
    notes the row gives. The pazer correction is applied before the comparison, and only while row 30
    still prints PA D4(e) ZER D4(s).
  - The clean scans corrected eight staffs:
    - the closing note becomes a quarter in mahpach, zarka, tevir, telisha gedola, pazer and karnei
      parah;
    - yetiv gains the grace note Y′ is sung on;
    - karnei parah gains its missing E4;
    - the High Holiday segol loses the G4 that is tied into its run.
- The file's top-level `key: "A"` tells the Learn-card staff to draw three sharps and to spell
  in-key notes without accidentals, so a natural sign appears only where the chart prints one. A
  note outside the key is spelled by the tutor's rule (raised 1st and 4th, lowered 3rd, 6th and
  7th), which gives the charts' own spellings: G♮ here, F♯ and B♭ in the High Holiday file.
- Rhythm is reduced to the staff's four values (`d` 1–4), as section A says. A grace note is drawn as
  a full eighth: zarka's F♯4 before KA, the D4 each telisha sings T′ on, and yetiv's Y′ (B4; A4 in the
  High Holiday file). Pazer's two opening D4s are one quarter note on the year-round staff (section A).
  Every figure keeps its full length, and a staff with more than eight notes widens; the longest,
  shalshelet, karnei parah and the High Holiday pazer, have fifteen.
- To re-verify an entry by hand:
  - read the mark's line in its row;
  - reduce it as section A says;
  - convert it with the `p` scale above (A4 = −2; each semitone down is −1);
  - compare it with the JSON.

  The card's play button plays the staff as tones, lighting each note, so the tune can be checked by
  ear.
- The High Holiday figures (section C) live in `data/trope/trope_motifs_hh.json`
  (`system: "highholiday"`, `key: "C"`: no signature, so B♭ and F♯ carry their accidentals), each entry
  `verified: true` with `source: "tropepatterns.md High Holiday #N"`. The motif builder never reads or
  writes that file (there are no High Holiday recordings to draft from), so it is edited by hand; the
  phrases builder checks it like the Torah file. The tutor draws it when Settings → Melody is *High
  Holidays*; the four marks it lacks say so on their cards.
- Neither file is ever rewritten for another key.
  - The Learn tab's key bar (and Settings → Sing along → Key) moves every note of the melody on
    screen by whole half steps, up to six either way, and redraws the staff in the key it lands on.
  - The chart's chromatic notes keep their degree (the lowered 7th, the High Holiday raised 4th), so
    each figure keeps its printed shape.
  - *Low voices* leaves the notes where they are, writes the small 8 under the clef and sounds the tune
    an octave down, the octave men sing both charts in.

  `docs/reference/torah-and-trope.md` → *Key and voice* has the details.

## F. Ideas this chart suggests

Each of these is a Feature seed in the improvement loop's ledger (`docs/IMPROVEMENT_LOG.md`), so a loop
session can pick one up. (The key control for the tune button that stood fifth here has shipped, as the
key bar described in section E, and so has the phrases tab that stood second: the Trope Tutor's
Phrases tab, with real Torah examples of each row.)

1. High Holiday recordings for the Torah Trainer's Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur readings: those
   readings now link to the tutor on the High Holiday melody, but their chant buttons still play
   PocketTorah's year-round recordings (a chip beside the link says so).
2. A "what comes next" drill: a phrase with one mark hidden, or the marks of a phrase to put in
   order.
3. Context variants on the Learn card: munach's shapes and the tevir-context mercha and kadma,
   each with the phrase they belong to (the figures are in `docs/trope_phrases_report.md`).
4. Teaching the end-of-aliyah sof pasuk, on the card and as a highlight of an aliyah's last verse
   in the Torah Trainer.
5. A munach legarmeh card.
6. A one-sheet phrase chart to print in the teacher's chosen key (the Phrases tab prints the
   whole chart in that key, over several sheets).
7. A staff for a whole reading, a verse to a parasha, drawn and played under the Hebrew (section G).

## G. Toward a parasha staff

The aim is a staff under any reading — a verse, an aliyah, a whole parasha — that draws and plays its
cantillation. The chart supplies the figures. This section records what a builder of that staff needs
to know, and what the chart leaves open.

- **The data** is `data/trope/trope_phrases.json`, built from sections B and C. The Trope Tutor's
  Phrases tab draws every row of it, and its renderer (`renderPhraseStaff`,
  `docs/reference/torah-and-trope.md`) is the first building block of this staff. For each
  melody it gives the key and every row as flat arrays:
  - `notes`: `p` in semitones from B4, `v` the printed value, `t` ticks at 48 to the quarter with a
    triplet note's real length, `g` grace, `r` rest, `tie` tied to the next, and `a` accents and
    tenuto lines;
  - `syl`: each syllable's text, whether a hyphen follows, its mark and the notes it covers;
  - `units`: each mark's notes;
  - `tup`: the triplets;
  - `slur`: the slurs, `dashed` for a dashed one.

  `figures.<melody>.<mark>` lists each mark's distinct figures by `[row, mark index]`, with the marks
  printed before (`prev`) and after (`next`) it; `^` and `$` are the row's edges.
- **Choosing a figure for a word.** The mark alone does not decide it.
  - A conjunctive — munach, mercha, mahpach, kadma, darga, telisha ketana, mercha kefula or yerach
    ben yomo — takes the figure whose `next` names the mark that follows it (section D).
  - Where the chart has no such figure, the fallback is its figure before the disjunctive the chain
    leads to; failing that, any figure of the mark.
  - A disjunctive's figure can change too. In the Torah chart the changes are small: revia's first
    note is a triplet eighth when the munach's triplet runs into it (rows 17–18), tevir's T′ is an
    eighth or a sixteenth (section D), and a geresh after kadma, the azla, opens with two quick
    notes (row 15). The High Holiday chart changes more: its tipcha before etnachta (rows 1–4) is
    not the tipcha of the sof pasuk clause (5–8), and its etnachta, sof pasuk, zakef katon, zarka
    and geresh each have two or three forms. So a disjunctive's figure is chosen like a
    conjunctive's, by `prev` and `next`, and the last verse of an aliyah takes the `[aliyah-end]`
    rows for its closing mercha, tipcha and sof pasuk.
  - The melody (`torah` or `highholiday`) picks the half of the file.
- **Words, as the text gives them.** A word joined to the next by a maqaf (־) usually has no mark
  of its own, so the pair is one word with one figure. Where the first word keeps one (a kadma 84
  times in the Torah, a tipcha once, Genesis 8:18), the pair is one word with two marks, sung in
  order. A vertical line (׀) after a munach is one of two signs that print alike. It is either the
  legarmeh line, which makes the munach munach legarmeh, or a paseq, a short pause that leaves the
  munach a connecting mark (Genesis 22:11, אַבְרָהָ֣ם ׀ אַבְרָהָ֑ם). The census's text draws the
  paseq smaller, and a staff builder's text has to tell the two apart as well. A double pashta, and
  the doubled telishas, segol and zarka, are one mark written twice: one sign at the word's edge,
  the other on its stressed syllable. A word can carry two different marks, most often a
  munach or kadma on an earlier syllable before a zakef katon, or a kadma before a geresh. They are sung
  in order, like two words.
- **Placing a figure on a real word** is the one thing the chart cannot give.
  - The chart sings every figure on its mark's own name (MER-CHA, T′-LI-SHA G′DO-LA), and the name's
    stress is no guide: pashta's high note falls on TA, not on the stressed PASH.
  - So the data keeps the printed underlay and adds no accent field.
  - The usual teaching puts the figure's opening notes on the syllables before the stressed one and its
    melisma from the stressed syllable on. That is a convention for the builder to confirm by ear
    against the PocketTorah recordings the tutor already plays.
  - Most marks sit on the stressed syllable. Pashta, zarka, segol and telisha ketana sit on a word's
    last letter and telisha gedola and yetiv on its first, so the stress has to come from the text.
- **Keys and voices.** The tutor's key bar functions (`shiftedKey`, `motifPitchPos`) transpose and
  spell these notes the way they do the Learn-card staffs, and *Low voices* works the same way.
- **What the Torah needs that the chart does not print.** `node scripts/build-trope-phrases.mjs --census`
  reads the whole Torah text (Sefaria's public export, the *Miqra according to the Masorah* edition)
  and writes `docs/trope_contexts_report.md`.
  - **Every mark has a figure.** Geresh muqdam, the only mark without one, never occurs.
  - **Conjunctives.** 95.4% of them stand before a mark the chart prints them before, and 96.1% with
    the chain fallback.
  - **The largest gaps:**
    - telisha ketana before kadma: 450, since the chart prints telisha ketana only at the end of a row;
    - kadma before zakef katon on one word: 159;
    - mercha before pashta: 147;
    - munach before munach: 141, nearly all covered by the fallback;
    - munach before gershayim: 59;
    - darga before munach: 59;
    - kadma before a munach that leads to zarka: 41;
    - munach before mercha: 37, all covered by the fallback;
    - mercha before zarka: 31.
  - **The last verse of an aliyah.** The Torah chart's one closing formula (mercha tipcha mercha sof
    pasuk) fits 65 of the 376 aliyah-final verses the census reads (PocketTorah's aliyot, the ones the
    Torah Trainer shows). The two others end inside the excluded Decalogues. Of the rest, 139 end
    mercha tipcha sof pasuk, 100 tipcha mercha sof pasuk, 71 tipcha sof pasuk and one sof pasuk alone.
    Hebcal's calendar ends two aliyot elsewhere (Terumah 2 at Exodus 25:40, Masei 1 at Numbers
    33:10); with its ends, 64 verses fit the chart's formula and 72 end tipcha sof pasuk. The High
    Holiday chart prints all four common closings, but in its own melody.
  - **The High Holiday readings.** In the four Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur readings, 94.0% of the
    conjunctives stand before a printed context, 95.2% with the fallback. None of the four marks the
    High Holiday chart leaves out occurs there.
  - **Left out.** Genesis 35:22 and the two Decalogues are marked with two cantillation systems at
    once, so the census leaves them out.

  Each gap is a place where a parasha staff needs a decision, a recording to listen to or a second
  source. The report lists every one with an example verse.
